`ledger-device-rust-sdk` doesn't support `stax` [platform](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-near/blob/develop/ledger_app.toml#L4).

The implementation is ongoing - [pr](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-device-rust-sdk/pull/109).

It appears `stax` hasn't really been sold yet, it probably has only been preordered.
